                        <p>Your strategy should serve as a source of truth. As you create posts or allocate resources, a strong social media strategy is a crucial gut check. Include information that:

                            Defines social media “buckets,” or content themes
                            Records core demographics and customer personas
                            Establishes brand values that should be represented on each platform
                            Shows clear goals and the key performance indicators (KPIs) that illustrate progress</p>

                        <h3>How much does social media strategy cost?</h3>
                        <p>A social media consultant or agency will likely provide a personalized estimate based on the scope of your social media strategy needs, the number of social platforms and what other marketing services may be involved.

                        </p>

                        <h3>What is business digital marketing and why is it important for my business?</h3>
                        <p>Digital marketing is the promotion or advertisement of your product, service, or business online or via the Internet. Depending on the business type, goals, or where the business is at in its business lifecycle, the efforts may vary. It is important to work with a marketing team that understands your goals and knows how to create a comprehensive strategy to be able to identify the most profitable channels.

                            Digital marketing consists of many different types of marketing strategies, but the spectrum of services generally consists of website design and development, search engine optimization, pay-per-click advertising, social media marketing, and content marketing strategies like blog writing, video marketing, and email marketing. Even within the above strategies are subsets of the different types of digital marketing.
                            
                            Within search engine optimization consists local search engine optimization, national search engine optimization, link building, and reputation management. Types of pay-per-click advertising include local pay-per-click advertising, national pay-per-click advertising, and Facebook advertising. Social media marketing plays across many different platforms depending on the type of business you are in, but some of the most important networks are Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, Pinterest, and YouTube. Content marketing consists of creating valuable and memorable content to be distributed to customers or those interested in your space.
                            
                            Each of these services plays important roles in a strategy. Your business may need some or all of them depending on many different factors. 
                            
                            Digital marketing has shifted the paradigm of marketing from one that uses an outbound approach to one that uses an inbound marketing approach. Customers know what they want and when they want it and they head online to get what they want when they want it. Gone are the days of fishing with a large net in the ocean and here are the days of fishing with sonar radar in a barrel. Inbound marketing helps businesses generate traffic to their website and turn website visitors into paying customers.
                            
                            Digital marketing is one of the most important types of marketing you can do for your business. Not only is it crucial in this digital age, but it also presents the best opportunity for ROI because it is attributable and trackable to identify where leads and sales are coming from on a minute-by-minute basis.</p>
